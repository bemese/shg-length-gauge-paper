To whom it may concern,

We wish to submit the article titled "Theory of surface second-harmonic 
generation for semiconductors including effects of nonlocal operators" for 
review. In this article we formulate a theoretical approach of surface 
second-harmonic generation from semiconductor surfaces based on the length 
gauge. We calculate the nonlinear second-order surface susceptibility tensor 
within the IPA and include the scissors correction, the cut function for 
extracting the surface nonlinear response, and  the contribution from the 
nonlocal part of the pseudopotentials. We test this approach with a clean 
Si(001)$2\times 1$ reconstructed surface with excellent results. This approach
is unprecedented and adds considerable precision and ease of calculation to 
previous attempts. The inclusion of nonlocal terms significantly changes 
the calculated spectra and offers a more complete view of surface second-
harmonic generation.
